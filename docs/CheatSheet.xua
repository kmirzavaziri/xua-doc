# -- #########################################
# # Templates
# Create a new XUA project in the current directory.
#    xua new project PROJECT_NAME

# Create a new super file in current directory's XUA project.
#    xua new super SUPER_NAME

# Create a new entity file in current directory's XUA project.
#    xua new entity ENTITY_NAME

# Create a new method file in current directory's XUA project.
#    xua new method METHOD_NAME

# Create a new service file for a specific language in current directory's XUA project.
#    xua new service SERVICE-NAME [-l LANGUAGE]
# where `LANGUAGE` can be Dart, PHP, Java, JavaScript, Kotlin, Objective-C, or Swift.

# Create a new interface file in current directory's XUA project.
#    xua new interface

# -- #########################################
# # Build
# The argument `PATH` in the following commands can be a file name or directory name, if you leave it empty, the xua engine will build all files inside project, unless you set `-c` or `--changes` flag which builds all the files that are changed from last build.

# Build a specific project.
#    xua build PROJECT [PATH] [-c]
# where the `PROJECT` can be `doc/latex`, `doc/html`, `server/php`, `marshal/dart`, `marshal/javascript`, etc.

# Build projects that are labeled as `quick` in `config.json`.
#    xua build quick [PATH] [-c]
# __Note:__ If you have the plugin installed, when you hit the save button (`Ctrl+S`) the plugin automatically quick-builds the file that is being saved.

# Build all projects.
#    xua build all [PATH] [-c]

# -- #########################################
# # Deploy
# Just like build, the argument `PATH` in the following commands can be a file name or directory name, if you leave it empty, `xua-ext` will deploy all files inside project, unless you set `-c` or `--changes` flag which deploys all the files that are changed from last build.

# It's possible to config `xua-ext` to deploy on several environments, which you can define in `.xua-ext/settings.json`, programmers usually work with two environments called `demo` and `production`, you can have a different deploy procedure for each environment.

# __Note:__ The `xua-ext` does not deploy any arbitrary given file, it only deploy source files and the files that are marked as [resource files](Units.html#Resource_Files) in `config.json`. The resources are only copied to the server, while the source files are  built first by `xua` command, and then the result gets deployed. 

# Deploy a specific project.
#    xua-ext deploy PROJECT ENV [PATH] [-c]
# where the `PROJECT` can be `doc/latex`, `doc/html`, `server/php`, `marshal/dart`, `marshal/javascript`, etc.

# Deploy projects that are labeled as `quick` in `config.json`.
#    xua-ext deploy quick ENV [PATH] [-c]

# Deploy all projects.
#    xua-ext deploy all ENV [PATH] [-c]

# -- #########################################
# # Clean

# ## Local Clean
# Clean a project from files with no source file and are not marked as [resource files](Units.html#Resource_Files) in `config.json`.
#    xua clean PROJECT

# Clean projects that are labeled as `quick` from files with no source file and are not marked as [resource files](Units.html#Resource_Files) in `config.json`.
#    xua clean quick

# Clean all projects from files with no source file and are not marked as [resource files](Units.html#Resource_Files) in `config.json`.
#    xua clean all

# ## Remote Clean
# Clean a project located on `ENV` from files with no source file and are not marked as [resource files](Units.html#Resource_Files) in `config.json`.
#    xua-ext clean PROJECT ENV

# Clean projects that are labeled as `quick` located on `ENV` from files with no source file and are not marked as [resource files](Units.html#Resource_Files) in `config.json`.
#    xua-ext clean quick ENV

# Clean all projects located on `ENV` from files with no source file and are not marked as [resource files](Units.html#Resource_Files) in `config.json`.
#    xua-ext clean all ENV

# -- #########################################
# # Methods as Commands
# XUA extension made it possible to call XUA methods as commands via cli. To call a method on specific environment, use
#    xua-ext call [ENV] Path.To.Method.MethodName argName0=actualValue0 ... argNameN=actualValueN
# If `ENV` is not specified, the command will run on local host.
